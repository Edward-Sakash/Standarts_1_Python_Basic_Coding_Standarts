"""
Create a file named task7.py and define a function named
my_custom_validation_function that takes ten positional arguments 
named one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten.

The body of the function may be left empty (with the pass keyword)
Then call this function with the first five arguments as True and
the last 5 as False.

Then check the style with flake8. If it produces any errors,
fix them and run it again until it produces no error.
